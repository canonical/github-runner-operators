# Contribute

## Overview

This document explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing enhancements to the codebase.

* Generally, before developing enhancements to this code base, you should consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/canonical/github-runner-operator/issues) explaining your use case.
* If you would like to chat with us about your use-cases or proposed implementation, you can reach us at [Canonical Charm Development Matrix public channel](https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-charmdev:ubuntu.com) or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
* All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically examines
    * code quality
    * test coverage

## Code of conduct

When contributing, you must abide by the
[Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct).

## Submissions

If you want to address an issue or a bug in this project,
notify in advance the people involved to avoid confusion;
also, reference the issue or bug number when you submit the changes.

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
  our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/canonical/github-runner-operators)
  and add the changes to your fork, properly structuring your commits,
  providing detailed commit messages and signing your commits.
- Make sure the updated project builds and runs without warnings or errors;
  this includes linting, documentation, code and tests.
- Submit the changes as a
  [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Your changes will be reviewed in due time; if approved, they will be eventually merged.

### Describing pull requests

To be properly considered, reviewed and merged,
your pull request must provide the following details:

- **Title**: Summarize the change in a short, descriptive title.

- **Overview**: Describe the problem that your pull request solves.
  Mention any new features, bug fixes or refactoring.

- **Rationale**: Explain why the change is needed.


- **Checklist**: Complete the following items:

    - The PR is tagged with appropriate label (`urgent`, `trivial`, `senior-review-required`, `documentation`).

### Signing commits

To improve contribution tracking,
we use the [Canonical contributor license agreement](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/ff2478d1-Canonical-HA-CLA-ANY-I_v1.2.pdf)
(CLA) as a legal sign-off, and we require all commits to have verified signatures.

### Canonical contributor agreement

Canonical welcomes contributions to this repository. Please check out our [contributor agreement](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors) if youâ€™re interested in contributing to the solution.

#### Verified signatures on commits

All commits in a pull request must have cryptographic (verified) signatures.
To add signatures on your commits, follow the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).


## Develop

For any problems with this charm, please [report bugs here](https://github.com/canonical/github-runner-operator/issues).

The code can be downloaded as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/canonical/github-runner-operators.git
```

The code structure is as follows

- `internal/`: Internal libraries for the applications
- `webhook-gateway`: The webhook gateway application code


### Test

This project uses standard Go testing tools for unit tests and integration tests.
You can have a look at the GitHub actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` to see how the tests are run in CI.

Run unit tests using:

```shell
go test -race -v ./...
```

Run `webhook-gateway` integration tests using:

```shell
APP_PORT=8080 WEBHOOK_SECRET=fake RABBITMQ_CONNECT_STRING="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/" go test -cover -v  ./webhook-gateway -integratio
```

It assumes you have access to a RabbitMQ server running reachable at $RABBITMQ_CONNECT_STRING.
You can use `docker` to run a RabbitMQ server locally:

```shell
docker run -d  --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4-management
```
